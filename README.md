# Coding-Challenge

- Please use the movie DB: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/trending/get-trending to generate an API_Key
- Fetch all trending movies and TV shows and display them in 2 different horizontal scroll views
- Each card should display the poster image and the name of the Show/Movie
- There is no need for pagination showing the content of the first page is enough
- on click show a detail page with the description and a link which opens YouTube and shows the trailer

- Test as you see fit
- Use MVVM as underlying architecture
