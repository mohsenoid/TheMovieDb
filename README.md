- Fetch all trending movies and TV shows and display them in 2 different horizontal recycler views
- Each card should display the poster image and the name of the Show/Movie
- There is no need for pagination showing the content of the first page is enough
- On click show a detail page with the description and rating. Nice to Have: A link which opens YouTube and shows the trailer
